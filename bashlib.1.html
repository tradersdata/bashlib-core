<h2>NAME</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>bashlib - library functions and framework for bash shell</p>
</div>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<div class="section">
<p class="code">
source /usr/local/share/bashlib/core
<span class="b code">use</span> <span class="u">some/func</span> [ <span class="u">trace|dbg|info</span> ]
</p>
</div>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
bashlib is a collection of libraries for the
<span class="b code u">bash</span>(1) shell and the framework to use
them. The functions are dynamically imported, usually in a script. This
manual describes the framework features and usage.
</p>
<p>
Sourcing <span class="code">/usr/local/share/bashlib/core</span> (example
location) initializes the framework by defining two functions:
<span class="b code">use</span> and <span class="b code">require</span>.
It also ensures environment variables <span class="b code">LOGNAME</span>,
<span class="b code">SELF</span>, and
<span class="b code">BASHLIB_PATH</span> are set.[1]
<span class="b code">LOGNAME</span> defaults to the output from
<span class="b code">whoami</span>(1) and
<span class="b code">SELF</span> is assigned the basename of the caller
(<span class="b code">$0</span>).
<span class="b code">BASHLIB_PATH</span>, explained below, gets a suitable
default if necessary.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="b code">use</span> and
<span class="b code">require</span> functions are not technically
required, as the libraries can be sourced directly. The functions are
recommended, however, because some libraries
<span class="b code">use</span> others, and implementation is within this
framework. Sourcing libraries directly without first sourcing
<span class="b code">bashlib/core</span> may work, but probably won't
without modifications.
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre>

<span class="b code">use</span> <span class="u">category/lib</span> [ <span class="u">trace|dbg|info</span> ]

</pre>
<p>
This is the core function, and its one required argument is the library file
to be sourced.  An optional second argument, if given, is passed through to
any error messages and can be used for a rudimentary stack trace or anything
else of interest to the programmer. <span class="b code">use</span>
provides a couple of features.
</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>
<h4>Search BASHLIB_PATH</h4>
</p>
<p>
<span class="b code">use</span> searches
<span class="b code">BASHLIB_PATH</span> analogous to the way the shell
uses <span class="b code">PATH</span>, only better&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a
relative path can be passed. For example, if /usr/local/share/bashlib is in
<span class="b code">BASHLIB_PATH</span>, and the file
/usr/local/share/bashlib/<span class="u">some/file</span> exists, it will
be found with:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
<span class="b code">use</span> <span class="u">some/file</span>

</pre>
<p><span class="b code">BASHLIB_PATH</span> allows library collections in different
locations (e.g. system, user, development) and relative paths allow library
hierarchies organized, remembered, and called by any criteria imaginable
(e.g. <span class="u">std/reverse</span>, <span class="u">ui/menu</span>,
<span class="u">file/fstat</span>, <span class="u">math/commify</span>,
<span class="u">admin/cron/log-time</span>).
</p>
<p>
<h4>Does not redundantly reload libraries</h4>
</p>
<p>
For many applications, loading a library once, often near the top
of the script, is optimal and sufficient.  For others, module use
may be conditional.  Still further, there may be dozens or more
places where it might be used, but not determined until run time.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to import the functon dynamically, only when needed.
<span class="b code">use</span> checks if a command by the name requested is already
defined and, if it is, returns immediately, skipping the reload of
the same code. This allows
<span class="b code">use</span>&nbsp;<span class="u">some/func</span> to be executed
multiple times throughout a program, with the file being sourced at most
one time.[2][3]
</p>
<p>
<h4>Variables set for different functions within library groups</h4>
</p>
<p>
The <span class="b code">use</span> function automatically sources related files
containing variable assignments, if they exist. This provides a facility for
functions sharing a <span class="b code">category</span> and/or
<span class="b code">subcategory</span> (i.e. directories) to also automatically share
the same variables, set consistently within groups and across executions.
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre>
<span class="b code">use</span> <span class="u">dir/subdir/func</strong>

</pre>
<p>
The <span class="b code">use</span> function sources each of the following files, if
it exists:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
dir/.vars
dir/subdir/.vars
dir/subdir/.vars.func

</pre>

</div>

<pre>

<span class="b code">require</span> <span class="u">VARIABLE</span> [ <span class="u nw"> --null-ok</span> ] [ <span class="u">trace|dbg|info</span> ]

</pre>
<p>
The <span class="b code">require</span> function is similar to
<span class="b code">bash:&nbsp;set&nbsp;-u</span> (or
<span class="b code">set&nbsp;-o&nbsp;nounset</span>). The differences
are: it operates on a specific <span class="u">VARIABLE</span>, rather than
being set generally; error messages are more informative; and it bails on a
variable that's set but null (empty string). This last behavior can be
changed with <span class="u nw">--null-ok</span>. Error messages will have
debug info appended if it's passed to the function, allowing something like
(in a script named "foo"):
</p>
<pre class="indent">
<span class="b code">require</span> <span class="u">VAR</span> <span class="u">[$SELF:$LINENO]</span>  # n.b. VAR not $VAR

</pre>
<p>
This exits with the following error message if <span class="u">VAR</span>
unset:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
[bashlib] require: $VAR is unset [foo:15]

</pre>
<p>
or exits with the following error message if <span class="u">VAR</span> is
null:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
[bashlib] require: $VAR is set, but null [foo:15]

</pre>
<p>
The latter would continue without event if <span class="u nw">--null-ok</span>
were added.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
</p>
<p>
1. A fourth variable, <span class="b code">PROG</span>, is set by
bashlib/core. <span class="b code">PROG</span> is deprecated, replaced
by <span class="b code">SELF</span>, but still set for for backwards
compatibility. It should not be relied upon.
</p>
<p>
Two other variables, <span class="b code">BASHLIB_STAT</span> and
<span class="b code">BASHLIB_ERR</span> are commonly used in modules.
They are guaranteed to exist any time an imported function returns a
non-zero status, if <span class="b code u">bashlib::liberr</span>(1)
is used to process trapped errors, as most libraries do.
</p>
<p>
2. In typical form, a library file contains a single function of the same
name. For example <span class="b code">std/lc</span> provides the
<span class="b code">lc</span> function from the
<span class="b code">std</span> category, which converts a string to
lower case:
</p>
<p class="code indent">
% . /usr/local/share/bashlib/core
% <span class="b code">use</span> <span class="u">std/lc</span>
% var=AbCd
% lc var
% echo $var
abcd

</p>
<p>
Library files are not limited to a single function. It is not required that
a function in the file match the filename. It doesn't have to contain any
functions at all, but then the <span class="b code">bashlib</span>
optimizations are completely unnecessary.
</p>
<p>     
When writing a library file, if it does not contain a function of the
same name, adding a dummy preserves the feature preventing redundant
importing of the same code. For example, <span class="u">some/crazylib</span>
provides multiple functions, none named
<span class="b code">crazylib</span>. Adding this to the library file
is all that is needed:
</p>
<p class="code indent">function crazylib { :; }
</pre>
<p>
3. The method that prevents redundant loading of functions prevents
overloading also. This possible feature has been considered, but only
theoretically as a specific need has never existed.
